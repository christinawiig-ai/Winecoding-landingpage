Build a dark, modern landing page.
The page should feel exclusive, minimal and “private community / secret builders club” style.

The HERO section already exists and is a black terminal-style animation

Use semi-transparent cards with blur, subtle borders, and a premium feel.
Each card should be semi-transparent (glassmorphism effect), slightly blurred, with subtle borders.
Use this exact content for the cards:
Card 1
Title: Vibecoding Workshops
Text:
Build from scratch without waiting for developers.
From zero ? full-stack-ready prototype.
Tagline:
Coding like a girl. Shipping like a boss.
Card 2
Title: Atelier Nights — Vika
Text:
Where bad ideas turn great in a gallery setting — with wine, art and low-light focus.
Tagline:
Community, code & cabernet.
Card 3
Title: Office Hours — Startuplab
Text:
Private sparring, live builds and honest feedback with people who actually ship.
Tagline:
The no-BS tech sisterhood.
Card 4
Title: Draft & Debug
Text:
For those of us more into malt.
Build. Debug. Share ugly first versions.
Tagline:
Tipsy prototypes. Serious outcomes.
Add a small line under the card grid that says:
“And sometimes… surprise formats.”


Create a “Community” section under the cards
Big heading:
This isn’t about collecting followers.
Body text:
It’s about building real things with women who can actually ship.
Add a small CTA link or button that says:
“Sip & ship for you? Request invite ?”

Create an “Organisers” section
Title:
Powered by
Logo Vibelabs
Logo Startuplab
Text Famous Female Founders & Wannabe Vibecoders
Add short micro-copy below:
Backed by people who have shipped before — and people brave enough to try.

Create a final CTA section
Big headline:
Ready to build?
Subline:
Code. Sip. Ship.
No heavy buttons. Keep this minimal and editorial.
