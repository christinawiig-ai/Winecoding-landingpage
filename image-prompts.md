## Sorolla-style (warm, golden, Mediterranean)

### 1. The Demo Night
Oil painting in the style of Joaquín Sorolla. A group of diverse women gathered around a large table outdoors at golden hour, Mediterranean terrace overlooking the sea. One woman is standing, gesturing excitedly at her laptop screen while the others lean in, captivated. Wine glasses and a carafe on the table, other laptops open. Warm golden sunlight, loose confident brushstrokes, luminous shadows. The energy of someone showing something they just built.

### 2. The Late Night Ship
Oil painting in the style of Joaquín Sorolla. A single woman alone at a rustic table on a Mediterranean balcony at night. Her face lit by laptop glow and a single candle. An empty wine glass beside her. She's smiling at the screen — the quiet triumph of shipping something at midnight. Warm amber and deep blue palette, visible brushstrokes, intimate and powerful.

### 3. The Wine Bug
Oil painting in the style of Joaquín Sorolla. Two women at a sunny café table, laptops open, one pointing at the other's screen with a look of theatrical horror. A wine glass has been knocked over, red wine spreading across the white tablecloth. The other woman is laughing. Mediterranean light, flowers, sea in background. Loose painterly style. The vibe: debugging is better with wine and friends.

## Krøyer-style (blue hour, Skagen, Nordic light)

### 4. Blue Hour at Startuplab
Oil painting in the style of P.S. Krøyer, Skagen school. A group of women walking together along a Nordic beach at blue hour, twilight sky. Some carry laptops under their arms, one holds a wine glass. Bare feet in the sand. That famous Krøyer blue-violet light, long soft shadows on wet sand. Luminous, atmospheric, serene. The feeling of community after a good session.

### 5. The Midsummer Hackathon
Oil painting in the style of P.S. Krøyer. A long table set outdoors on a Nordic beach at midsummer, white night sky. Women seated around the table with laptops, candles, wine bottles, wildflowers. Soft blue-pink light reflecting off the sea. Linen dresses, relaxed postures, deep conversation. Krøyer's signature luminous skin tones and atmospheric blue shadows.

### 6. Office Hours on the Beach
Oil painting in the style of P.S. Krøyer, Skagen painters. Three women sitting in a cluster on a Nordic beach, laptops balanced on knees, golden evening light from the side. One is explaining something, gesturing with her hands. A bottle of white wine stuck in the sand between them. Soft dune grass, vast sky. That Krøyer quality of quiet, glowing intimacy.

## Playful / humorous

### 7. The Merge Conflict
Oil painting in the style of Joaquín Sorolla. A dramatic Renaissance-style composition: two women at opposite ends of a long table, both pointing at the same laptop with passionate intensity. Other women around the table watch like spectators at a tennis match. Wine glasses raised mid-air. Mediterranean terrace, golden light. Painted with humor and grandeur — a merge conflict elevated to art.

### 8. It Works On My Machine
Oil painting in the style of Joaquín Sorolla. A woman standing triumphantly on a chair at a Mediterranean terrace, laptop held above her head like a trophy. Around her, other women are applauding, wine glasses raised in toast. Golden sunset light, sea behind, flowers everywhere. The energy of deploying to production on the first try. Heroic, warm, celebratory.

### 9. The Sommelier Debug
Oil painting in the style of P.S. Krøyer. A woman holding a wine glass up to the light, examining it with the same intensity her friend next to her is examining code on a laptop screen. Nordic blue hour light, both faces lit with focus and concentration. Parallel compositions — one debugging wine, one debugging code. Atmospheric, witty, beautifully lit.

## Style consistency tips
- Always include "visible brushstrokes, painterly texture"
- Specify "diverse women" to maintain the inclusive vibe
- For Sorolla: emphasize "golden light, Mediterranean, luminous shadows"
- For Krøyer: emphasize "blue hour, Nordic beach, atmospheric light, Skagen"
- Use the hero image as a style reference if Nano Banana supports it
